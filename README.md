# discordia-extensions
seperate package for discordia's extension module

## Note
- Package is just a copy and paste of discordia's [extension module](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/blob/master/libs/extensions.lua)
- Only difference is the module name, one comment and 2 local definitions for micro-optimizations
- I only made this a seperate package so that I don't have to include [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) as a dependency just for the extension module in order to work on some other packages that require the same functions as extension does
- If the [repository owner](https://github.com/SinisterRectus) of Discordia would like me to remove this repository regardless of reason, feel free to contact me via Discord `Arivistraliavatoriar#2678`, luvit discord server, or through issues.

## Installation
- Make sure you have [luvit](https://luvit.io/install.html) installed
- Run the command `lit install alphafantomu/discordia-extensions`
- `require('discordia-extensions')` to reference the library

- There is no [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) release, but only `init.lua` is necessary to use the library.

## Documentation
Documentation isn't given on this repository as this is only a splitted copy of a module of another repository, please refer [here](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia/wiki/Extensions) for documentation.
